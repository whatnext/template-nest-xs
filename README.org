#+title: Template::Nest::XS

Repository for XS version of Template::Nest with Raku bindings. Is is very fast , up to 100x faster than Raku version.

This version works only on Linux and on Windows. It gets ~libtemplatenest.so~ / ~templatenest.dll~ from
~libraries~ directory. So, the C++ code must be re-compiled and
~libtemplatenest.so~ replaced on updates.

The dynamic library can be compiled from its sources when it needed.
It is possible to compile them using Visual Studio by opening the solution file.
See https://github.com/whatnext/template-nest-xs/tree/main/resources/libraries/src
After compilation , rename the dll and move it to the resources/libraries directory.

For Linux,
there is a script for compiling called compile.sh. 
It is found it at https://github.com/whatnext/template-nest-xs/tree/main/resources/libraries/src/TemplateNestDll.
