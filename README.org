#+title: Template::Nest::XS

Repository for XS version of Template::Nest with Raku bindings.

This version works only on Linux and on Windows. It gets ~libtemplatenest.so~ / ~templatenest.dll~ from
~libraries~ directory. So, the C++ code must be re-compiled and
~libtemplatenest.so~ replaced on updates.
